//TODO: Step 5 - Create a new class called StoryBrain.

//TODO: Step 7 - Uncomment the lines below to include storyData as a private property in StoryBrain. Hint: You might need to change something in story.dart to make this work.



//TODO: Step 23 - Use the storyNumber property inside getStory(), getChoice1() and getChoice2() so that it gets the updated story and choices rather than always just the first (0th) one.

//TODO: Step 8 - Create a method called getStory() that returns the first storyTitle from _storyData.

//TODO: Step 11 - Create a method called getChoice1() that returns the text for the first choice1 from _storyData.

//TODO: Step 12 - Create a method called getChoice2() that returns the text for the first choice2 from _storyData.

//TODO: Step 25 - Change the storyNumber property into a private property so that only story_brain.dart has access to it. You can do this by right clicking on the name (storyNumber) and selecting Refactor -> Rename to make the change across all the places where it's used.

//TODO: Step 16 - Create a property called storyNumber which starts with a value of 0. This will be used to track which story the user is currently viewing.

//TODO: Step 17 - Create a method called nextStory(), it should not have any outputs but it should have 1 input called choiceNumber which will be the choice number (int) made by the user.

//TODO: Step 20 - Download the story plan here: https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1KU6EghkO9Hf2hRM0756xFHgNaZyGCou3

//TODO: Step 21 - Using the story plan, update nextStory() to change the storyNumber depending on the choice made by the user. e.g. if choiceNumber was equal to 1 and the storyNumber is 0, the storyNumber should become 2.

//TODO: Step 22 - In nextStory() if the storyNumber is equal to 3 or 4 or 5, that means it's the end of the game and it should call a method called restart() that resets the storyNumber to 0.

//TODO: Step 27 - Create a method called buttonShouldBeVisible() which checks to see if storyNumber is 0 or 1 or 2 (when both buttons should show choices) and return true if that is the case, else it should return false.
